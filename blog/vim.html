<p>Switching from using PhpStorm to Vim is a huge step but, I'm willing to give it a go. I have building this website in Vim with the help of google to help me with a few Vim commands. I found few online resources that suggest to replace ESC key for Caps key this way you wouldn't be going all the way to the ESC key to switch modes.</p>

</p>

<p>A few things for me to look into</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bracket completion for html and php &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.</li>
    <li>Language completion for html and php.</li>
    <li>Alias to change to frequent used directories.</li>
    <li>Learn more Vim commands to help me move around better.</li>
</ul>
