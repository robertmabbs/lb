<p>Saturday night, I said goodbye to my Windows. Gone is Adobe, Office and PhpStorm software. My goal is to only use free and open sourced software. Armed with a usb stick with  Arch Linux on it. I managed to get through the installation stage and just do a few little changes. I ended up choosing i3 gaps, this is going to be a intresting ride.</p>
